# react-scripts

This provides configuration for FLM's isomorphic React apps.

## Install

tl;dr

``` bash
npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app --scripts-version=git+ssh://git@github.com/firstlookmedia/react-scripts.git my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Usage

`react-scripts` expects at least the following files:

```
src/index.js  # entry to the client-side app
server.js     # entry to the server
```

The output will become:

```
build/server.js             # compiled server
build/manifest.json         # manifest pointing source files to compiled
build/assets/32f2q8fj3.js   # example compiled app
build/assets/2d0823jd.css   # any other compiled assets (css, images, fonts)
```

---

#### `npm start`

Starts the development environment:

- The app server, which auto-reloads on [http://localhost:3232](http://localhost:3232)
- A webpack dev server, which hot-reloads and proxies requests to the app server,
  on [http://localhost:3233](http://localhost:3233)

#### `npm build`

Builds the production assets to the `build` folder.

#### `npm test`

You will need `watchman` to use `npm test` without `CI=true`. To install on OSX `brew bundle` in this directory.

Runs mocha tests. `react-scripts` will look for any file named `__spec.js`.

`react-scripts` adds chai assertion helpers for
[enzyme](https://github.com/producthunt/chai-enzyme)
and [sinon](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai)

Example test:

``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import { mount } from 'enzyme';
import { expect } from 'chai';

import Wrapper from '.';

describe('Wrapper', () => {
  it('renders supplied children', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(
      <Wrapper>
        <div>child</div>
      </Wrapper>
    );
    expect(wrapper).to.contain(<div>child</div>);
  });
});
```
